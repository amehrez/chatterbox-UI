# Large models (if any, though user seems to want to include them? best to check via git status size warnings, but standard practice is to ignore large binaries if they can be downloaded)
# For now, excluding common large model extensions if they are not tracked, but user might want them. 
# Leaving specific model files unignored for now as requested to fork/upload project.
